# 🎾 Tennis Tournament Simulator

This project was developed as part of one of my first university courses in Computer Engineering. It's a C++ console-based simulation of a tennis tournament, allowing players to be registered, matches to be simulated, and statistics to be displayed.

## 📌 Features

- Register and store tennis players.
- Simulate matches between two players.
- Ball hitting and player movement based on ability and probability.
- Full tennis scoring system (15, 30, 40, advantage, etc.).
- ASCII-based court visualization.
- Detailed match statistics.
